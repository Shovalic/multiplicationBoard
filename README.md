# multiplicationBoard
This game was built for kids who want to practice their skills in the multiplication table. The site was built from a personal story when my 7 year old cousin and I love learning the multiplication table together. This is, among other things, our quality time. So now it also has sentimental value for me.

The site was developed in a completely Vanilla method - html, css, JS.

The emails are sent according to who the student chooses.

Hope you will enjoy, Shoval.
